# The Ultimate Google TensorFlow Developer Certificate Exam Study Guide

The purpose of this repository is to detail the necessary resources to pass the TensorFlow Developer Certificate in the shortest time possible, minimizing the effort required by centralizing relevant information. You will find study material, course references, and notebooks examples. Keep in mind that the specified resources aren't free, so by following this guide, you must have a minimum budget. Let's begin!

## Honorable Mentions

Consider the [Tensorflow Certification Study Guide](https://github.com/nicholasjhana/tensorflow-certification-study-guide#tensorflow-certification-study-guide) laid the foundation for this repository. That repo is excellent and includes more information and available material.

## Required Knowledge

### Courses
Before moving on to Deep Learning, there are some basic concepts you should manage with ease. First, you need to achieve the minimum understanding of Mathematics (Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Probability and Statistics). On the other hand, you need to have strong Python programming skills. Below are the recommended materials to achieve the necessary knowledge in these areas.

Math Courses:
- [Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning#courses)
- [Introduction to Statistics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/stanford-statistics)

Programing with Python Courses:
- [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python#courses)
- [Python 3 Programming Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming#courses)
- [CS50‚Äôs Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/) (free resource)

Now that you have achieved the minimum knowledge requirements, let's jump to the üå∂Ô∏è things. 

First of all, even though it is not necessary to know about Machine Learning to obtain the Tensorflow Developer Certificate (only Deep Learning is required), the following course turns out to be optional on this path. Nevertheless, it is an excellent specialization to start with, and I strongly recommend doing it.

1. [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) (opcional)

Now, the following specializations are *essential* to obtain the certification. The Deep Learning Specialization and The Tensorflow Developer Specialization are indeed complementary. The Deep Learning Specialization develops all the necessary concepts by adopting a more theoretical approach. While the Tensorflow Developer Specialization adopts a more practical and applied approach, applying everything learned in the previous specialization and putting hands into practice.

3. [Coursera Tensorflow Developer Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice) 

#### Deeper Dive into Tensorflow Developer Certificate Specialization

We will be particularly interested in further developing the material given in this specialization. That is because the Google TensorFlow Developer Certification exam forms its bases on this specialization, so completing it is crucial. All the material listed below is available in the Deep Learning AI public repo: [DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Public Repo](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/tensorflow-1-public). Below you can see all the notebooks given in the courses, excluding their weekly assignments, which are a good practice resource for exam preparation.

Finally, the ‚≠ê indicates the highly recommended notebooks to review before taking the exam. Try to focus on implementing and writing the models on your own, tuning the hyperparameters, and enhancing the model predictions with the corresponding datasets, like manually defining the learning rate decay. These notebooks are a faithful representation of how the exam exercises are developed, so it's important to achieve good results in their corresponding metrics.

5 horas
Sabes a tiempo real el resultado
el minimo puntaje por ejercicio es de 3
es decir si nuestro punteje es de 5,5,5,5,2 perdemos el examen 
los ejercicios son incrementales en dificultas (empezar por el ultimo) y supuestamente tienen una ponderacion d epeso en la nota en funcion de su dificultad
se sube solo el modelo guardado localemtne, se puede entrenar en colab bajar el modelo y subirlo
esoecial cuidado en la dimensionalidad del output del modelo, puede ser que el mismo entrene localmente, pero si el modelo no poseee la dimensionalidad del output como especifica cada ejercicio, el coso no los podra evaluar
